# CanaryWire
CanaryWire creates disguised canary files that alert you via Discord the instant they are opened. It deploys a `.pdf` in Windows Explorer with no visible executable extension. When opened, the canary silently captures system intelligence, takes a screenshot, and sends a formatted embed alert to your Discord webhook.
